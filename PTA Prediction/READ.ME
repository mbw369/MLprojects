Here are several machine learning models developed to predict the presence of purulence on needle aspiration attempt of suspected peritonsillar abscess.
I used SciKit Learn for ANN, random forest, logistic regression, and k nearest neighbors, which are what I included in the manuscript. I also explored SVM briefly.
The data is PTA.xlsx. You should only need the python 3 with the usual packages (I'm new at this, so I'm not entirely sure on the details).

The data is from real patients, deidentified. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Please contact me with any questions or requests.
